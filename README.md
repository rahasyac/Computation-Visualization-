# Setting 

For the purpose of this Project, the dashboards will visualize and tell the following story:

1. Factors that affect the amount of credit given to a customer.
   
2. Visualize how the external factors - such as the categorical values, age - affect the
credibility of a client.

3. Finding out the credibility of a client using history of past payments.
   
4. Predicting the probability of a customer making a payment on time.
   
The end goal of this project would be to analyze the factors that contribute towards a client being a high credit-risk customer. Not only would this help us explore the trends that make a client credible, based on their credit limits and payment records, but also reduce a bankâ€™s losses by withholding credit to those who may default on their loans.
